### Objective
The business goal is to find a model that can explain success of a contact, i.e. if the client subscribes the deposit.
Such model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping in a 
better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and 
affordable set of potential buying customers.
